# UnaMKR Mini Tutorial

This tutorial will guide you through getting your UnaMKR Mini up and running in a minimum of time!

# Prerequisites

* Microprocessor or microcontroller (we'll use the USB to TTL USB adapter in this tutorial)
* Computer with at least 1 available USB port
* And … UnaMKR Mini :-)

# Getting Started

## Read Sigfox ID + PAC

First of all, we need to get the information specific to your UnaMKR Mini, especially its unique Sigfox ID and one-time Product Activation Code.

* Scan the QR code on your UnaMKR Mini
* Write down the Sigfox ID and PAC
* Note that the QR code also contains the Bluetooth MAC address (not used in this guide)

## Activate Sigfox service

Before your UnaMKR Mini is able to use Sigfox service, it is mandatory to activate it:

1. Browse to [https://buy.sigfox.com/activate](https://buy.sigfox.com/activate)
2. Pick your country
3. Click on Next
4. Enter UnaMKR Sigfox ID and PAC and click on Next
5. Enter account details and click on Subscribe
6. Your subscription is active!

## Install Sigfox Antenna

UnaMKR Mini requires an external antenna to be connected to properly use Sigfox services.

* Connect the IPEX-end (small connector) to SMA cable to the UnaMKR
* Screw on the antenna to the SMA connector
* Verify that the IPEX-end is sturdely connected to the communication module.

## Connect to UnaMKR Mini to USB adapter

On UnaMKR mini, make the following connections:

* Connect to 3V3 (red)
* Connect to GND (black)
* Connect to Pin D11 - UART_RX (green)
* Connect to Pin D08 - UART_TX (purple)

On USB to TTL adapter, make the following connections:

* Connect to 3V3 (red)
* Connect to GND (black)
* Connect to TXD (green)
* Connect to RXD (purple)

The connection settings are the following:

* Baud Rate: 115200
* Data Bits: 8
* Parity: None
* Stop Bits: 1
* Flow Control: None

Use these settings using a Serial terminal application of your own choice.

Below are some examples of applications:

* Mac OS, `minicom` or `Serial`
* Windows, `putty`
* Linux, `minicom`

When successfully connected:

* Send the test command `AT?`
* If UnaMKR Mini replies `OK`, Congratulations: you can proceed to the next step!
* If not, go back and check you have properly followed every previous step.

## Detecting Sigfox RC

Because of specific countries regulations regarding radio frequencies usage, Sigfox uses different sets of Radio Configurations ([https://build.sigfox.com/sigfox-radio-configurations-rc](https://build.sigfox.com/sigfox-radio-configurations-rc)).

[Sigfox Monarch](https://build.sigfox.com/monarch) enables compatible-devices to automatically detect Radio Configurations that are usable at current location.

So, next, we will use UnaMKR Monarch function to autodetect Sigfox Radio Configuration.

*( of course, the Radio Configuration can be set manually but where is the fun in that? )*

!> Note: UnaMKR Radio Configuration default value is 4.

* Tell UnaMKR to scan for Monarch frame for 5 minutes
  * Send `AT$MONARCH=300`
* As soon as a compatible Radio Configuration is detected, UnaMKR returns `OK` and stores the Radio Configuration Number in memory.
* If no Radio Configuration have been received, UnaMKR returns `FAILED`.
* The current Radio Configuration can be read by sending `AT$ZONE?`.

Note: UnaMKR keeps memory of the last set or last detected Radio Configuration, even after power reset.

## Sending first message

If UnaMKR successfully set its Sigfox Radio Configuration, you can now properly use Sigfox and start sending messages.

* Log on to Sigfox Backend ([https://backend.sigfox.com](https://backend.sigfox.com/))
* Click on top tab "DEVICES"
* Input your UnaMKR Mini Sigfox ID
* Click on button "Filter"
* Click on the Sigfox ID value
* Click on the sidebar "MESSAGES"

Switch back to your Serial terminal application:

* Send the following command `AT$SF=42,0`

Back to your web browser with Sigfox Backend and watch "42" appearing in the Messages list.

Congratulations, you just sent your first message with UnaMKR Mini through Sigfox 0G Network.
